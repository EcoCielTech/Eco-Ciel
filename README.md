## About EcoCiel

EcoCiel is a groundbreaking platform designed to foster environmental sustainability through advanced technology. It uniquely integrates diverse data types, utilizing state-of-the-art models for real-time analysis and predictive insights. Our goal is to transform green choices into tangible rewards, uniting individuals and businesses in the pursuit of a sustainable future.

### Real-time Analytical Graph (RAG) Model

At the heart of EcoCiel lies our innovative Real-time Analytical Graph (RAG) Model. This model, developed with Azure DataPipeline and Azure Data Warehouse, specializes in dynamic data integration. It processes a wide range of data sources - from streaming weather and UV data to air quality indices and static financial data. Our RAG model is further empowered with a classifier model, where after rigorous testing with various algorithms, we've implemented an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model due to its outstanding accuracy. This amalgamation of data helps in creating personalized challenges best suited for users, enhancing their engagement and sustainability efforts.

### RNN for Air Quality Index Monitoring

We've also implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for time-based Air Quality Index (AQI) Monitoring. This feature uses real-time streaming ML data to provide users with accurate and up-to-date air quality assessments, helping them make more informed decisions about their health and environmental impact.

## Technical Implementation

### Mobile and Web Interface

- **Flutter App**: Our Flutter-based app offers a multilingual interface (supporting English, Hindi, and Tamil) for enhanced user engagement. It's designed to be intuitive, ensuring a seamless experience for users tracking their environmental impact and participating in sustainability challenges.
